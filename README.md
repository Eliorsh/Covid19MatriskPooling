## Introduction

This repository presents a novel approach to COVID-19 testing that enhances laboratory efficiency and reduces virus transmission rates. By prioritizing individuals based on their risk profiles rather than random selection, this method enables targeted containment measures. 

A simulation compares the effectiveness of this risk-based approach across two populations, both identical at time t_0, with a fixed daily test limit. Untested individuals remain contagious per infection distribution parameters, while identified cases are isolated to prevent further spread. Our goal is to demonstrate the benefits of this approach in curtailing COVID-19 transmission.

# Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm - Efficient Pooling for COVID-19 Tests ðŸš€ðŸ§ª

The **Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm** is a high-efficiency testing solution that organizes samples by risk to minimize tests while accurately identifying infected individuals. This adaptable algorithm remains effective even in high-prevalence scenarios, making it suitable for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

## âœ¨ Key Advantages
- **Rapid Identification**: Enables swift detection within pools, accelerating containment.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizes testing resources, reducing costs and laboratory workload.
- **Adaptability**: Effective across infection rates, maintaining accuracy in diverse conditions.

## ðŸ§  Method Overview

The Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm is designed to optimize the testing process by utilizing risk-based assessment. To understand its benefits, letâ€™s first consider a **Random Pooling** method, which lacks risk prioritization.

### Random Pooling Process
In a random pooling setup, individuals arrive and are divided arbitrarily. For this example, assume they are split into two groups, with each group being tested using a single shared test tube. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Pooling and Testing**: Each group submits their samples into a collective test tube. The test tube is then analyzed to detect any sign of infection.
2. **Result Interpretation**:
   - **Negative Result**: If the test tube returns a negative result, everyone in that group is released without further testing.
   - **Positive Result**: If the test tube returns a positive indication, each individual in that group must undergo separate, individual testing to identify the infected person(s).
   
While simple, this method has drawbacks:
- **Higher Resource Consumption**: When a pooled test returns positive, every member of that group must be retested individually, increasing time and resource demands.
- **Low Precision**: Random grouping does not account for individual infection risk, which can lead to inefficient testing, especially in populations with varying risk profiles.

### Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm - Enhanced Pooling Based on Risk
In contrast, the Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm incorporates individual risk factors to prioritize high-risk individuals, making the testing process more resource-efficient and accurate.

#### Step 1: Risk Assessment
Individuals are ranked by their infection probability based on predefined risk factors. This stage ensures the pooling process targets high-risk samples, which maximizes the effectiveness of each test.

#### Step 2: Matrix Pooling
After risk assessment, samples are arranged in a matrix where each row and column represents a pooled group. This configuration minimizes the number of tests required while allowing precise identification of infected individuals.

#### Step 3: Identifying Infected Patients
Following the pooled test results, the algorithm identifies individuals likely to be infected and refines the pool with additional testing if needed. This step ensures both speed and accuracy in isolating infected patients.
