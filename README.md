# Prioritizing tests for the Covid-19 virus

## Introduction:


This repository presents a novel approach to COVID-19 testing, aiming to enhance efficiency in laboratory operations and reduce the spread of the virus. The proposed method suggests testing individuals based on their risk profiles and probability of being infected with COVID-19, rather than relying on random selection as commonly practiced in laboratories today. By prioritizing individuals with higher risk profiles, this approach seeks to minimize transmission rates and promote targeted containment measures. To evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy, a simulation is constructed, comparing two populations in different countries. The simulation assumes that populations in both countries are identical at a specific time t_0, and a limited number of tests are available daily. Additionally, it considers the contagiousness of untested infected individuals based on predefined infection distribution, while tested individuals are assumed to be isolated and non-contagious once identified. Through this simulation, we aim to provide insights into the potential benefits of risk-based testing and its impact on curtailing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

## âœ¨ Description

The **Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm** is designed to combat the spread of COVID-19 by providing an efficient, economical, and rapid testing solution. The algorithm smartly arranges test samples into a "risk matrix" based on the risk profile of each sample, significantly reducing the number of tests required to identify positive cases.

### Key Advantages:
- **Rapid Identification**: Quickly detects real patients within a pool of test subjects, enabling faster response and containment of the virus spread.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizes the use of testing resources and laboratory teams, making it more cost-effective.
- **Adaptability**: Unlike traditional pooling methods that struggle when infection rates are high, this algorithm remains effective even during outbreaks, ensuring consistent and reliable results.

While originally designed for COVID-19, the method is versatile and can be adapted for other infectious diseases and various testing scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Summary of Method

The Matrisk-Pooling Algorithm operates by analyzing test samples and grouping them based on the risk profile of each subject. This approach ensures that fewer tests are needed to identify infected individuals in a population. The method accelerates the identification of patients, enabling quick action to stop the spread of the virus.

### Step 1: Risk Assessment
The algorithm first analyzes individual risk factors and ranks each subject based on their probability of being infected. This step is crucial for ensuring that the pool testing focuses on high-risk areas.

### Step 2: Matrix Pooling
After risk assessment, the samples are arranged into a matrix where each row and column contains pooled samples. The algorithm minimizes the number of tests required by combining groups of samples and testing them together.

### Step 3: Identifying Infected Patients
Based on the results of pooled tests, the algorithm identifies individuals who are most likely infected and refines the pool with further testing if needed. This step ensures both speed and accuracy in identifying real patients.
